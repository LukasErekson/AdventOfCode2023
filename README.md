# Advent of Code 2023
## Working in Java

As part of Advent of Code 2023, I want to refamiliarize myself with
Java. I first studied Java in high school, but I haven't used it much
since then. I'm excited to complete the Advent of Code challenges to
learn more about Java as I'm studying it again after working a lot in
languages such as Python, Ruby, TypeScript, and Rust.
